# How it works
You can setup cams in the config.
You will have some categories where you will put each camera in.
Each camera can have a 3d model if you dont see a camera (must be setup)
Each camera can also be hacked by players.

# setup

</br>
You will have to setup your own ps dispatch alert for the hack
</br>

```
	['camerhacker'] 			 	 = {['name'] = 'camerhacker', 			  		['label'] = 'Hackaparaat', 				['weight'] = 1000, 		['type'] = 'item', 		['image'] = 'Hackaparaat.png', 			['unique'] = false, 	['useable'] = true, 	['shouldClose'] = true,	   	['combinable'] = nil,   ['description'] = ''},
```
